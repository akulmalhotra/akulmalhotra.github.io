I worked on this project during the second semester of my junior year under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=TrujKPcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works">Dr. Ananthakrishna Chintanpalli</a>.</p> 

**Briefly explain the problem you worked on.**
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The problem I worked on is the removal of the baseline wander from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using wavelet-based filtering in real time. </p>
