# About Me
Hello! I am a senior year student in the Electrical and Electronics engineering department at Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani. Over the course of my undergraduate studies, I've worked on a range of projects: from hardware acceleration for machine learning to analysing urban community noise using signal processing. Keep up to date with my research and other endeavours on this webpage.
