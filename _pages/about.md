Hello! I am Akul Malhotra, a graduate student in the Electrical and Computer engineering department at Purdue University. I do research in hardware acceleration for  artificial intellence systems using both CMOS and post CMOS technologies. I did my undergraduate studies at Birla Institute of Science and Technology (BITS), Pilani.

As someone stepping into the world of research, I understand the difficulty one can have while going through research papers, which are generally difficult to understand and contain too much jargon. To tackle this problem with respect to my work, I have written (and plan to) blog posts for each of my projects, which highlight the key ideas of the project and the applications it has in everyday life. The goal of these posts is to answer the what/why/how's of my work, and hopefully make my research more accessible and easy to understand as a consequence. Hope you find it useful! </p>
