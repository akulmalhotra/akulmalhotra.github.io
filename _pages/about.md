Hello! I am Akul Malhotra, a senior year student in the Electrical and Electronics engineering department at Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani.  Over the course of my undergraduate studies, I've worked on a range of projects: from hardware acceleration for machine learning to analysing urban community noise using signal processing. Keep up to date with my research and other endeavours on this webpage. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
As someone stepping into the world of research, I understand the difficulty one can have while going through research papers, which are generally difficult to understand and contain too much jargon. To tackle this problem with respect to my work, I have written blog posts for each of my projects, which highlight the key ideas of the project and the applications it has in day to day life. The goal of these posts is to answer the what/why/how's of my work, and hopefully make my research more accessible and easy to understand as a consequence. Hope you find it useful! </p>
