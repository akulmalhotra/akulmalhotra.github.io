Here is a list of the research projects I have worked on:

<b>Bayesian Neural Network Hardware</b> <br>
 August 2019 - January 2020 <br>
 <p style='text-align: justify;'>
 I worked on designing hardware accelerators for Bayesian neural networks using post CMOS technologies. The design was envisioned using both resistive random access memories (RRAMs) and spintronic devices. </p>

 <b>Analysing the Ranchland's Hum: An Urban Community Noise, from the perspective of human annoyance</b> <br>
 May 2019 - August 2019 <br>
 
 <b>Wavelet Based Filtering for Baseline Wander Removal in ECG Signals on a TI DSP Kit</b> <br>
 January 2019 - May 2019 <br>
 <p style='text-align: justify;'>
 I worked on implementing a wavelet-based filter on the Texas Instruments TMS3320C5515 DSP board to remove the baseline wander from ECG signals. </p>
