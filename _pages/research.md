This page lists the research and academic projects I have worked on. As someone stepping into the world of research, I feel that research papers are difficult to understand and contain too much jargon for someone who hasn't aleady worked in the particular field. Not only does this discourage interested students but also inhibits multidisciplinary research. To tackle this problem with respect to my work, I have written blog posts for each of my projects, which highlight the key ideas of the project and the applications it has in day to day life. The goal of these posts is to answer the what/why/how's of my work, and hopefully make my research more accessible and easy to understand as a consequence.
