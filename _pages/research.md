Here is a list of the research projects I have worked on:

<b>Bayesian Neural Network Hardware</b> <br>
 August 2019 - January 2020 <br>
 <p style='text-align: justify;'>
 I worked on designing hardware accelerators for Bayesian neural networks using post CMOS technologies. The design was envisioned using both resistive random access memories (RRAMs) and spintronic devices. </p>

 <b>Analysing the Ranchland's Hum: An Urban Community Noise, from the perspective of human annoyance</b> <br>
 May 2019 - August 2019 <br>
 <p style='text-align: justify;'>
 I worked on this project as a MITACS Globalink research intern at the University of Calgary. The Ranchland's Hum is a low frequency urban noise nuisance which has been bothering the residents of the Ranchland's neighbourhood of Calgary for several years. The objective of my research was to analyze the hum audio data to find out which hum events can be heard by the hum ear and thus, cause annoyance. </p>  
 
 <b>Wavelet Based Filtering for Baseline Wander Removal in ECG Signals on a TI DSP Kit</b> <br>
 January 2019 - May 2019 <br>
 <p style='text-align: justify;'>
 I worked on implementing a wavelet-based filter on the Texas Instruments TMS3320C5515 DSP board to remove the baseline wander from ECG signals. </p>

 <b>Design of a non volatile SRAM cell with self write termination</b> <br>
 August 2018 - December 2018 <br>
 
 <b>Marine Soundscape Analysis of the Angria Bank Coral Reef Region</b> <br>
 May 2018 - July 2018 <br>
 
 Some other projects I've worked on:
 
 <b>An RF Adapter to make a PS/2 keyboard wireless</b> <br>
 <p style='text-align: justify;'>
 I designed transmitter and receiver modules using the LPC 2148 microcontroller, which when connected to the keyboard and computer respectively, allowed the keyboard to function wirelessly. </p>
