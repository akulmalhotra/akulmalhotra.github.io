Here is a list of the projects I have worked on:

<b>Bayesian Neural Network Hardware</b> <br>
 August 2019 - January 2020 <br>
 I worked on designing hardware accelerators for Bayesian neural networks using post CMOS technologies. The design was envisioned using both resistive random access memories (RRAMs) and spintronic devices.
